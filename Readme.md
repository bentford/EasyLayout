# EasyLayout

### Overview

EasyLayout is my experimental framework for performing quick layout of views.  It is the goal of this framework to replace AutoLayout, which I beleive is awful for laying out views in code.

My thesis is that EasyLayout will take less code and less effort than AutoLayout.  The framework is in it's infancy, but it is quite powerful and very effective in it's current state.

Although it is in a rudimentary state, it is quite useful as is.

### TODO

* Provide sample project illustrating it's use.
* Improve documentation
* Finish the framework
