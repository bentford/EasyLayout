# EasyLayout

### Overview

EasyLayout is my experimental framework for performing quick layout of views.  The goal of this framework to replace AutoLayout, which is sort of awful for laying out views in code.

EasyLayout requires very little code and effort to build complex layouts.  

### TODO

* Provide sample project illustrating it's use.
* Improve documentation
* Add more layout methods
